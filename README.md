Download RAMS and WikiEvent datasets into ./data folder.

## Checkpoints
Our checkpoints are available here.
coming soon...

## Evaluation 
Evaluate performance on RAMS
'sh script/test_RAMS.sh'
Evaluate performance on WikiEvents
'sh script/test_Wikievents.sh'


## Reimplement by yourself
In training stage, we utilize documental AMR graph. Hence, preprocess data first.
### Transition-based AMR decoder

### Coreference Resolution

### Training
